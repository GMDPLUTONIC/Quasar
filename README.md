# Quasar:
An efficient, useful, programming language for making large numbers.

## Features:
- Mathematical syntax: make complex mathematical equations in very short lines of code using premade/custom extensions.
- Easily extensible: easily make your own extensions using other extensions or from scratch.
- Cross-program functions: use functions from other programs. Just make sure to add the extra files to your program folder!
- Tiny syntax: Quasar is built for being small and very efficient. You can make some of the largest numbers ever using HALF the amount of characters usually needed for large numbers!

## Compilation:
As of 10/17/2025, I have not and do not plan to make a compiler/interpreter for Quasar.

## Tutorial:
Making your own large numbers in Quasar is very easy. As stated before, you can make complex/simple equations using our mathematical syntax.

### Making your first large number in Quasar:+
1. Make a new file with any name you want. Just make sure to add .qs at the end to show that it's made in Quasar.

2. Open your newly made Quasar file.

3. Define your `Main` function. One example is shown below

```
Main
    hyp(100,100)
```
In the function used (hyperoperation), the 1st number is the hyperoperation level (100th level), and the 2nd number is the base and exponent.

### Making your own functions in Quasar:
To define your own function using Quasar, you have to write something like this:
```
Your-function-name
    // definition
```

## Inspiration:
I made Quasar because I wanted people to have the ability to make stuff like Loader's number while not requiring to learn complex programming or mathematics.
